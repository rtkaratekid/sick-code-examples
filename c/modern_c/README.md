#### Takeaways
---
A) C and C++ are different: don't mix them, and don't mix them up.  
B) Don't panic.  

1.1) C is an imperitive programming language.  
1.2) C is a compiled programming language.  
1.3) A correct C program is portable between different platforms.  
1.4) A C program should compile cleanly without warnings.  

2.1) Punctuation characters can be used with several different meanings.  
2.2) All identifiers in a program have to be declared.  
2.3) Identifiers may have several consistent declarations.  
2.4) Declarations are bound to the scope in which they appear.  
2.5) Declarations specify identifiers, whereas definitions specify objects.  
2.6) An object is defined at the same time it is initialized.  
2.7) Missing elements in initializers default to 0.  
2.8) For an array with n elements, the first element has index 0, and the last
has index n-1.  
2.9) Each object or function must have exactly one definition.  
2.10) Domain iterations should be coded with a for statement.  
2.11) The loop variable should be defined in the initial part of a "for".
